**Transparent Donation Tracker**

A Blockchain-Based Solution for Trustworthy NGO Donations

Transparent Donation Tracker is a blockchain-powered donation management system designed to improve transparency, accountability, and trust in non-profit organizations (NGOs). Many NGOs struggle with donor confidence due to opaque fund usage, delayed reporting, and reliance on centralized databases that can be altered or selectively disclosed. This project addresses these challenges by leveraging smart contracts and decentralized technology.

Built using Solidity, the system ensures that every donation and fund movement is permanently recorded on-chain. Donations are locked by default and released only when predefined project milestones are completed and confirmed. This milestone-based approach guarantees responsible fund usage and eliminates unauthorized withdrawals. In case a project is cancelled or abandoned, donors are automatically eligible for refunds—without manual intervention or trust assumptions.

🔗 Why Blockchain?

Blockchain provides immutability, decentralization, transparency, and automated rule enforcement—making it uniquely suited to solving trust issues in the NGO sector. Unlike traditional systems, on-chain records cannot be manipulated, hidden, or retroactively changed. Donors gain real-time visibility into how and when their contributions are used.
